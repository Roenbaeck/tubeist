# Tubeist
Tubeist is an iPhone streaming app that streams fMP4 over HLS written in Swift 6. It is a project I created in order to learn Swift and I initially relied a lot on the help of large language models. The goal of this app is to stream high quality HDR content, primarily to YouTube. It is not aimed at streamers who want to interact with their audience and therefore seek to minimize latency. This app is better suited for streaming events, sports, or other long running non-interactive streams.

## Usage
Please note that in its current state the app may still have bugs, but it is becoming usable. It currently has to be compiled and installed by yourself and relies on a server capable of ingesting fMP4 / HLS. There is a rudimentary stream server that can be used for testing available here: https://github.com/Roenbaeck/hls-relay.

## TestFlight
A TestFlight version is on its way. Link will be made available here soon.
