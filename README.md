# Tubeist
Tubeist is an iPhone streaming app that streams fMP4 over HLS. It is a project I created in order to learn Swift and I initially relied a lot on the help of large language models.

# Usage
Please note that in its current state the app is barely usable, has to be compiled and installed by yourself, and relies on a server capable of ingesting fMP4 / HLS. There is a very rudimentary one-time stream server that can be used for testing available here: https://github.com/Roenbaeck/hls-relay
