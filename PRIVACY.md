# Privacy Policy for Tubeist

**Effective Date:** 2025-01-01

Thank you for using Tubeist. We are committed to your privacy. This privacy policy explains our practices regarding any data collected by this application.

**No Personal Data Collection**

We want to be very clear: **Tubeist does not collect any personally identifiable information from you.**  This means we do not collect your:

* Name
* Email address
* Phone number
* Location data
* Device identifiers (e.g., UDID, IMEI)
* Usage data that can be tied back to you

**How the App Functions**

Tubeist is a live streaming app that transmits video and audio data directly to an HLS-relay which forwards this to third-party services you configure. We do not store or process this data ourselves. Ideally you run your own HLS-relay, but if you do not, you need to check their privacy policy for any data they may collect.

**Third-Party Services**

While our app itself does not collect your personal data, it may interact with third-party services that have their own privacy policies. These may include:

* **Streaming Platforms (e.g., YouTube, Twitch):**  When you stream using Tubeist, the data you transmit goes indirectly to these platforms, and their privacy policies govern that data. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any streaming platforms you use.
* **Web Overlay Services:** If you use web overlays, the providers of those overlays may have their own privacy practices.

**We have no control over the data collection practices of these third-party services.**  It is your responsibility to review their privacy policies.

**No Cookies or Tracking Technologies**

Tubeist does not use cookies, tracking pixels, or other similar tracking technologies to collect information about your use of the app.

**Children's Privacy**

Our app is not specifically directed towards children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. As we do not collect any personal information, this is inherently addressed.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our privacy policy from time to time.
